# AyHeader

The reusable component is to create header for new applications. Just install the component and use the tags to generate the navigation bar.

# Installing the component in your application
npm install git+https://github.com/amityadav/ay-header.git

Then in your app.module.ts import the component
import {AmitHeaderComponent} from 'ay-header';

and use the tags in your template to generate the navigation bar.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
